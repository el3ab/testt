<h2>    What Is testt?</h2>

<p>testt is a Proof of Stake Cryptocurrency. The first two weeks after release will consist of a two week Proof of Work period.</p>

<h2>Why testt?</h2>

<p>It is the goal of the testt developers for everyone involved in the Cryptocurrency revolution to have access to the exciting developments that have been taking place. An ASIC-friendly, mixed PoW/PoS coin with eventual anonymous transaction capabilities has been sorely overlooked.</p>

<p>The testt developers believe that progress should never be held back. ASICs use much less energy than GPUs and are orders of magnitude more efficient. The energy used mining Scrypt coins for years to prolong the days of GPU mining was a truly enormous waste of resources on a global scale. Why hold back progress? testt encourages it.</p>
